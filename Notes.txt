# Notes
# Make an adjacency structure? - Or at least a similar function, that return the neighbors.
# For DFS memorize path up to it?
# Can create an array the same size as the maze, and each element would hold the path up to it
# For UCS need to create a similar array holding the costs.
# A* would be sort use UCS array, and apply Manhatten closeness.

When adding to the fringe, include the coordinates of the node that sent it. Or maybe just current pathlist...
